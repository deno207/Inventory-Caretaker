This project requires JRE (Java Runtime Enviroment) version 14.x
in order to run on your system. You will need to install this yourself.

To run the project, you have two options.
You can either use the provided start scripts (.sh for linux or .bat for windows)
or you can double click the jar file (or right click and select 'run with java').
Both the jar file and the scripts should be marked as executable, so either
option should work.

====Note====
I have noticed that (aleast on ubuntu) launching via the scripts and
launching via clicking on the jar use different databases. I currently
believe that this might be because I used relative file paths to
identify the location of the database file, and opening the application
via clicking on the jar might have a different working directory then if
you open the application via the script.
